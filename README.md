## Solutions

Each folder contains a list of problem statements divided into three categories Basic, Intermediate and Advanced along with official solutions.<br>
The **README file** available inside each folder provides links to **Best Solutions from the Community.**

## How to play with these solutions on Colab

Open Google Colab and follow these steps:

  1. Click on **File -> Open Notebook**
  2. Navigate to **Github** tab
  3. Enter the url to the .ipynb file (Jupyter notebooks)
  4. [See Picture here](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Assets/Colab_Example.png)

## Resources References with Learning Plan

The **[Resources.md](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md)** file contains links to external resources for learning and solving these challenges.

This Repository contains a list of Reference Links to Online Resources for learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and other prerequisites like Maths and Frameworks.

This guide is divided into four sections:

1. [General Tips](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#1-general-tips)
2. [Beginners](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#2-beginners) - For those who don't have knowledge about any programming language.
3. [Intermediate](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#3-intermediate) - For those who have some basic idea about what ML is.
4. [Advanced](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#4-advanced) - For those who have some practical experience and want to explore advanced Frameworks like Tensorflow.

**NOTE:**

1) This guide contains list in the order in which I learnt them, please go through the list and follow the order which suits best for you.
Best wishes for your journey into ML.

2) For hands-on experience please find the corresponding practicals mentioned in Week-wise modules in the main directory.

3) I'll keep updating this page so makes sure you star mark the repository and visit it frequently.
