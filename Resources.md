# Resources References with Learning Plan

This Repository contains a list of Reference Links to Online Resources for learning Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and other prereqisites like Maths and Frameworks.
<br><br>
This guide is divided into four sections:

1. [General Tips](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#1-general-tips)
2. [Beginners](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#2-beginners) - For those who don't have knowledge about any programming language.
3. [Intermediate](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#3-intermediate) - For those who have some basic idea about what ML is.
4. [Advanced](https://github.com/shubham99bisht/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Resources.md#4-advanced) - For those who have some practical experience and want to explore advanced Frameworks like Tensoflow.

**NOTE:**

1) This guide contains list in the order in which I learnt them, please go through the list and follow the order which suits best for you.
Best wishes for your journey into ML.

2) For hands-on experience please find the corresponding practicals mentioned in Weekwise modules in the main directory.

3) I'll keep updating this page so makes sure you star mark the repository and visit it frequently.
